A discrete plugin to add counter/time/timestamp to mails received with shortcodes that can be added anywhere on your mail

== Description ==
### Contact Form Counter
At a glance this plugin does the following:
* Is an extension for the plugin "Contact Form 7", which helps the administrators to add counter/time/timestamp to the mail received.
* The plugin creates a shortcode, which can be added to the desired field of the form.
* Administrators can switch between Counter, Time and Timestamp.
* Provisions have been provided to enter a text that is to be added as a prefix to the desired field where the shortcode will be placed.
* Also, the number of digits can be provided by the admin which would appear on opting the counter option. eg: 00000009
* The plugin makes it more convenient this way if the shortcode is entered on the subject field of the form as each mail received will be considered independent as a counter/time/timestamp would be automatically added to the subject field even though the subject line provided is the same.
